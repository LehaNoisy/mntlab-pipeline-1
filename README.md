            The Scripted Jenkinsfile are stored in github repo git@github.com:MNT-Lab/mntlab-pipeline.git (root location in repo), 
        Each student commits all step-by-step changes in own branch named {student}. Initial source = ‘master’ branch
        Where {student} is a first char from name + surname (all in lower case). Example: Aleksandr Mazurenko = father

        Requirements for the Pipeline:
            - For the remote Jenkins execution should be restricted on student node (SLAVE var).
            Locally it can be done where student wants
            - ‘Preparation (Checking out)’
            Checkout code from {student} repo
            - ‘Building code’
             Should contain building code stage
            Additional commands:
            gradle build - instruction for gradle to execute build task

            - ‘Testing code’
            Should contain 3 parallel execution of tests
                 Stages:  ‘Unit Tests’, ‘Jacoco Tests’, ‘Cucumber Tests’
            Additional commands:

            gradle cucumber – performs Cucumber tests
            gradle jacocoTestReport - Generates code coverage report for the test task.
            gradle test - Runs the unit tests.

            -  ‘Triggering job and fetching artefact after finishing’
            On this stage the job MNTLAB-{student}-child1-job should be triggered with {student} branch parameter. (the job from    previous DSL lab). Job should fetch code from ‘MNT-Lab/mntlab-dsl’ from {student} branch.
            - Pipeline should wait for finishing triggered job, take created artefact.

            - ‘Packaging and Publishing results’
            On this stage the job should:
            a) take:
            -  ‘jobs.groovy’ file (from child1-job archive), 
            - ‘Jenkinsfile’, 
            - built ‘gradle-simple.jar’ 

            - Should create new artefact ‘pipeline-{student}-{buildNumber}.tar.gz’ (where buildNumber - number of the current build)
            c) Should attach this artefact to current job and Push to Nexus

            - ‘Asking for manual approval’
            Once previous stage successful the job should ask for deployment this artefact.

            - 'Deployment'
            Artefact should be pulled from Nexus and deployed (unpack and execute) ;
            Use command ‘java -jar gradle-simple.jar’

            - !!! Implement handling  errors on each stage. The message (feedback) should be sent by email to DL (distribution list) with proper error description: failed stage, what has happened , when … etc. If pipeline status is ‘Success’ – send final email about this as well
            - !!!! Pull/Push functionality should be implemented as functions in pipelines and called in appropriate stages.
